## Skills System

Repository skill names and directories use exactly one `apex-` prefix, including
imported skills. Explicit integrations must use the new names: `azure-defaults`
becomes `apex-azure-defaults`. There are no old-name compatibility wrappers.
Agent names, public npm commands, instruction filenames, upstream identities,
and externally installed skills are unchanged. See the
[complete migration map and provenance][skill-migration].

### Skill Structure

Each skill follows a standard layout:

```text
.github/skills/{name}/
├── SKILL.md                    # Core overview (≤ 500 lines)
├── references/                 # Deep reference material (loaded on demand)
│   ├── detailed-guide.md
│   └── lookup-table.md
└── templates/                  # Template files (loaded on demand)
    └── artifact.template.md
```

### Progressive Loading

Skills use discovery metadata (`name` and `description`), then the full `SKILL.md`
when selected, then references or templates only when needed. There is no alternate
digest skill tier. Runtime artifact compression is a separate context-management concern.

### Invocation And Harness Boundaries

`user-invocable` defaults to `true`; `disable-model-invocation` defaults to `false`.
A hidden skill is absent from the slash menu. A manual-only skill cannot be selected
automatically by the model. These flags do not authorize tools or bypass human gates.

Local prompt files are adapters, not Agent Host entry points. Host manual entries include
`apex-host-workflow-start`, `apex-host-git-commit`, and `apex-host-debug-log-export`.
Select the owning agent first; skills inherit its model/tools. Workflow recovery uses
`apex-host-workflow-start` with an explicit `resume` operation. Source validation and
model labels do not prove native discovery, runtime attachment, or model eligibility.

### Skill Catalog

The system contains skills across several domains. The full, always-current
list is generated from `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` and surfaced in the
[Architecture Explorer](../../../reference/architecture-explorer/). The total
count is computed by `tools/registry/count-manifest.json`. A grouped overview:

| Domain               | Skills                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The table is a grouped overview; the filesystem and Explorer provide the current inventory.
For procedure ownership, `apex-docs-writer` owns gardening and documentation reviews;
`apex-agent-authoring` owns authoring assessments and their reference-only design history.
`apex-context-management` retains context audits, log export, and runtime compression;
`apex-workflow-engine` retains entry, recovery, and DAG routing.

## Instruction System

### Glob-Based Auto-Application

The `applyTo` glob declares a file-matching scope for automatic attachment. A matching
authoring file does not prove a rule is attached during runtime in either harness.
Agents must load missing required guidance; essential approval, security, output, and
stop rules remain in production agent bodies. The table summarizes scope rather than
duplicating every glob; exact patterns live in `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`.

| Instruction                    | `applyTo`                                                            | Enforces                                                       |

When multiple instructions apply to the same file via overlapping `applyTo` globs,
precedence rules determine which takes priority. See
`.github/instructions/references/precedence-matrix.md` for the full matrix.
Short version: Azure Policy compliance (Tier 1) always wins over domain IaC (Tier 2),
which wins over cross-cutting cost rules (Tier 3), which wins over general code quality (Tier 4).

**`iac-bicep-best-practices.instructions.md`** and
**`iac-terraform-best-practices.instructions.md`** are the
track-specific instructions that enforce
two mandatory rules across all IaC projects (Bicep and Terraform):

1. **Cost Monitoring**: Every deployment must implement the governed budget
   notification contract, Action Group routing, anomaly detection, and
   parameterised notification inputs.
2. **Repeatability (zero hardcoded values)**: Templates must deploy to any
   tenant/region/subscription without source-code modification. `projectName` must
   be a parameter with no default; all tag values reference parameters;
   `.bicepparam`/`terraform.tfvars` is the only place for project-specific defaults.

### Enforcement Over Documentation

:::note[Golden Principle]
Mechanical enforcement over documentation — if it can be a linter check, it
should be one. Documentation is for humans; machines enforce rules.
:::

Deterministic validators enforce structural contracts where possible. Advisory guidance,
runtime attachment, and human approvals still need execution evidence and review;
not every instruction has an executable check.

## Creating a Custom Skill

This section walks through creating a new skill from scratch.

### Step 1: Scaffold

Copy an existing skill (for example
[`apex-azure-defaults`](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/tree/main/.github/skills/apex-azure-defaults))
as a starting point and rename the directory:

```bash
cp -r .github/skills/apex-azure-defaults .github/skills/apex-my-new-skill
```

The expected structure is:

```text
.github/skills/apex-my-new-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Core overview (≤ 500 lines)
├── references/       # Deep reference material
└── templates/        # Template files for artifact generation
```

Authoring rules live in
[`agent-skills.instructions.md`](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/blob/main/.github/instructions/agent-skills.instructions.md).
After scaffolding, review frontmatter against the authoring rules, then run
`npm run validate:skills` plus `npm run validate:agents` to verify.

### Step 2: Write SKILL.md

The SKILL.md file requires YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: apex-my-new-skill
description: "Short description of the skill's purpose.
  USE FOR: keyword triggers.
  DO NOT USE FOR: anti-triggers."
compatibility: List of compatible agents
---
# My New Skill

Quick-reference tables, decision frameworks, and pointers to deeper content.
```

**Frontmatter rules** (from `.github/instructions/agent-skills.instructions.md`):

- `name` must match the folder name, use kebab-case and exactly one `apex-` prefix, and stay within 64 characters
- `description` must be an inline string (not a YAML block scalar)
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines — move deep content to `references/`

### Step 3: Add References and Templates

Use the three levels of disclosure:

| Level | Directory     | Loaded When                   | Content                            |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1     | `SKILL.md`    | Agent reads the skill         | Overview, quick-reference tables   |
| 2     | `references/` | Sub-task needs deep knowledge | Detailed guides, lookup tables     |
| 3     | `templates/`  | Output generation phase       | Structural skeletons for artifacts |

Example: a pricing skill might have `SKILL.md` with a service-to-tool
mapping table, `references/pricing-guidance.md` with detailed MCP tool
usage, and `templates/cost-estimate.template.md` with the output skeleton.

### Step 4: Wire Into Agent Bodies

Add a skill reference in the relevant agent's `.agent.md` body:

```markdown
## MANDATORY: Read Skills First

1. **Read** `.github/skills/apex-my-new-skill/SKILL.md`
```

That's the entire wiring. The skill is now connected to the agent.
There is no separate registry entry to update — skill wiring is
discovered at runtime by `tools/scripts/validate-orphaned-content.mjs`,
which scans agent bodies for `Read .github/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
references.

> Earlier versions of the registry carried a `skills` (and
> `capability_skills`) array on each entry. Those fields were removed in
> the context-window-optimization pass — they duplicated information
> already present in agent bodies and made every agent edit a two-file
> change.

### Step 5: Validate

```bash
# Check skill format, size, and references
npm run validate:skills

# Check skill body size and cross-references
npm run validate:skill-checks

# Verify agent registry consistency
npm run validate:agent-registry
```

### How Skill Discovery Works

Agents discover skills through **description keywords**. When a user's
request matches keywords in the skill's `description` field (USE FOR /
DO NOT USE FOR), VS Code automatically suggests loading that skill.
Write descriptions with specific, searchable trigger words.
