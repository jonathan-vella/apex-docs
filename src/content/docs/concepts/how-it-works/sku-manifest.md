## What is the SKU Manifest?

`agent-output/{project}/sku-manifest.{json,md}` is the per-project,
mutable source of truth for **creative SKU decisions** — App Service
plans, VMs / VMSS, SQL, Cosmos, AKS node pools, Redis, APIM, App
Gateway, and Storage replication tiers.

The JSON file is canonical; the markdown is a rendered view for human
review. Agents (CodeGen, Deploy, As-Built) read the JSON
programmatically. They never re-derive SKUs from artifact prose.

## Why a manifest?

Three problems the manifest solves:

1. **Single source of truth** — pre-manifest, SKU choices lived in
   prose across `02-architecture-assessment.md`,
   `04-implementation-plan.md`, and IaC code. Drift between them was
   common.
2. **Multi-environment / multi-region first-class** — environments
   (dev/test/prod) and regions (primary + failover) get explicit shape
   without duplicating the whole assessment per env.
3. **Cost-pricing writeback** — `cost-estimate-subagent` patches
   `cost_estimate_monthly_usd` per service via the same atomic-write
   discipline as governance constraints. Architects never type prices
   from parametric knowledge.

## Scope: what belongs

In scope (`services[]`):

- App Service Plans / Web Apps / Function Apps
- VMs / VM Scale Sets
- SQL Database / Managed Instance
- Cosmos DB (where throughput is a SKU)
- AKS node pools (per-pool VM SKU)
- Redis Cache, API Management, Application Gateway
- Storage Account replication tier (LRS / ZRS / GRS / RA-GRS)

Explicitly **out of scope** (the exclude list):

bandwidth, Log Analytics, vnet, subnet, NSG, route table, public IP,
diagnostics. These remain documented in plan narrative; the coverage
validator treats SKU literals in these categories as legitimate
non-manifest entries.

## Lifecycle

| Step | Agent             | Action                                                              |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `02-Requirements` | Rev 1 — **user pins only**. Empty `services[]` is the common case   |
| 2    | `03-Architect`    | Rev 2 — full authoring from priced `candidate_sets[]`               |
| 3.5  | `04g-Governance`  | Emits findings against the manifest (read-only)                     |
| 4    | `05-IaC Planner`  | Rev 3 — reconciles findings; runs `requires[]` cross-check          |
| 5    | `06b`/`06t`       | Reads JSON; resolves IaC via `iac_logical_names.{bicep\|terraform}` |
| 6    | `07b`/`07t`       | Pre-flight quota/region. Substitutions via block-with-escalation    |
| 7    | `08-As-Built`     | Bidirectional drift: manifest ↔ Azure ↔ IaC; writes `actual_sku`    |

Lifecycle status flows through `decisions.sku_manifest_status` in
session state:
`draft → reviewed → locked → deploying → deployed | drift`.

## User pins vs architect-derived

Every entry has a `source`:

- **`user-pin`** — a hard constraint the user volunteered at Step 1.
  Never auto-changed downstream. If a planner or deploy step needs to
  alter a pinned SKU, the workflow escalates to the Architect via the
  step-N → step-2 return edge.
- **`architect-derived`** — chosen by `03-Architect` at Step 2 from
  priced `candidate_sets[]`. Reconciled by the Planner at Step 4 for
  governance compliance; `source` stays `architect-derived`.
- **`deploy-substitute`** — substituted at Step 6 when quota or
  regional capacity forces a change. Always paired with an
  `decisions.sku_overrides[]` entry recording the escalation
  resolution.

## Cost-estimate dual mode

`cost-estimate-subagent` accepts three exclusive input modes:

| Mode | Input              | Purpose                                                                |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A    | `resource_list`    | Back-compat per-resource list                                          |
| B    | `manifest_path`    | Per-service pricing **+ atomic `cost_estimate_monthly_usd` writeback** |
| C    | `candidate_sets[]` | A-vs-B comparison; emits `decisions[]`; **no writeback**               |

The Architect's workflow at Step 2 is:

1. Build `candidate_sets[]` of competing SKUs per decision.
2. Call cost-estimate in Mode C to price them.
3. Pick winners; compute `sla_achieved` from SKU + zonal + region.
4. Write rev 2 to the manifest.
5. Call cost-estimate in Mode B for deterministic price writeback.

## Block-with-escalation (Step 6)

When pre-flight quota or regional SKU availability fails:

1. Deploy agent surfaces the conflict and available substitutes (via
   the `apex-azure-quotas` skill) to the human through the orchestrator.
2. The human chooses one of four `sku_conflict_resolution` enum values:
   `revert_to_plan` / `accept_substitute` / `change_region` / `abort`.
3. After N=3 round-trips with no acceptable substitute, `abort`
   surfaces as an explicit option — no silent deadlock.
4. On resolution, the deploy agent appends to `decisions.sku_overrides[]`
   (an array — never dynamic keys) and writes a new manifest revision
   with `source: "deploy-substitute"`.

## Validators

| Validator                   | Scope                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `validate:sku-manifest`     | Schema + semantic (unique IDs, monotonic revisions, env keys, stamps, allowlist cross-check, freshness) |
| `validate:sku-iac-coverage` | Bidirectional manifest ↔ IaC code (explicit SKU literals **plus** AVM module defaults)                  |
| `derive:sku-allowlist`      | Projects `04-governance-constraints.json` into the manifest's `sku_allowlist_snapshot`                  |

Both validators **hard-fail** on errors. The coverage validator runs
diff-aware in pre-push to keep CI fast. Legacy projects opt out by
dropping a `.sku-manifest.skip` sentinel into their
`agent-output/{project}/` directory.

## Governance allowlist projection

`04g-Governance` invokes `node tools/scripts/derive-sku-allowlist.mjs <project>`
after Step 3.5 (governance) discovery. The script translates Deny-effect policies with
`azurePropertyPath` ending in `.sku.name` / `.skuName` / `.sku_name` /
`.vmSize` into the manifest's `sku_allowlist_snapshot`. The downstream
validator cross-checks `services[].size` against the projection. The
derive script is idempotent — re-running on unchanged input is a no-op.

## Pricing freshness

`validate:sku-manifest` emits WARN when:

- `services[].cost_estimated_at` exceeds `APEX_SKU_PRICING_TTL_DAYS` (default 30 days)
- The manifest's `updated_at` exceeds `APEX_SKU_MANIFEST_TTL_DAYS` (default 90 days)

`cost-estimate-subagent` Mode B writeback patches both
`cost_estimate_monthly_usd` and `cost_estimated_at` per service,
keeping freshness deterministic.

## Multi-stamp manifests

Optional `stamps[]` top-level field lets a single workload describe
multiple independent deployments (per-tenant, per-region overlays).
Each stamp may pin different `regions[]`, an environment subset, and
sparse `service_overrides` (keyed by `services[].id`). Validator
checks uniqueness, environment subset, and service-id references.
When `stamps[]` is absent the manifest behaves as a single-stamp project.
