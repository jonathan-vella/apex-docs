## Agent Anatomy

Every agent definition follows a standard structure:

```yaml
# Frontmatter
---
name: 06b-Bicep CodeGen
description: Expert Azure Bicep IaC specialist...
model: ["GPT-5.6 Terra (copilot)"] # (1)!
tools: [list of allowed tools] # (2)!
disable-model-invocation: true
handoffs:
  - label: "Step 6: Deploy"
    agent: 07b-Bicep Deploy # (3)!
    prompt: "Deploy the Bicep templates..."
---
# Body (≤ 500 lines)
## MANDATORY: Read Skills First
1. **Read** `.github/skills/apex-azure-defaults/SKILL.md` # (4)!
2. **Read** `.github/skills/apex-azure-artifacts/SKILL.md`
```

1. Model selection — agent frontmatter is authoritative; changes require explicit approval
2. Tool allowlist — agents only access tools they need
3. Handoff target — the next agent in the workflow
4. Skills are loaded on demand to preserve context budget

The frontmatter is machine-readable metadata. The body is the agent's full operating
manual — the runtime loads it into the system prompt at invocation.

### Tools

Agents interact with external systems through **tools** — structured interfaces provided
by MCP servers and the VS Code runtime. Each agent's frontmatter declares a `tools:`
allowlist that restricts which tools it can call. Common tool categories:

- **MCP tools**: Cloud API wrappers (Azure pricing queries, GitHub operations, Terraform registry lookups)
- **File tools**: Read and write workspace files (create artifacts, read prior step outputs)
- **Terminal tools**: Execute CLI commands (Bicep build, Terraform validate, Azure CLI)
- **Subagent tools**: Delegate to specialised subagents via `#runSubagent`

### Handoffs

Agents do not communicate directly. Instead, each agent produces **artifact files**
in `agent-output/{project}/` that the next agent reads as input. The Orchestrator
routes through human handoffs to the next main agent, preserving user approval
at each gate. At approval gates, the Orchestrator writes a
`00-handoff.md` summary document that enables session resume.

### Local And Agent Host Boundaries

Local prompt files are adapters, not Agent Host entry points. On Agent Host, use
the shared skill and explicitly select its owning main agent before consequential
work. Skills inherit the caller's model/tools; they do not switch agents or grant
permissions. Keep Local discovery settings where needed, but do not treat legacy
discovery flags as a security boundary or proof of Host support.

Production main agents, including `10-Challenger`, use
`disable-model-invocation: true` and require human selection. Explicit caller
allowlists must not override that boundary. Keep essential approval, security,
output, and stop rules in main agent bodies: authoring `applyTo` matches do not
prove runtime attachment. Local and Agent Host behavior need separate verification;
source validation alone does not establish runtime support or model eligibility.

### APEX And Generic Application Workflows

APEX deployment agents consume approved IaC handoff and environment artifacts. They do not restart
the generic `apex-azure-prepare` workflow or require its application preparation plan. Missing APEX code,
an expected manifest, or a usable handoff returns to CodeGen; legacy evidence must be converted to
a current JSON handoff before preview or apply. Generic application workflows retain their own approved
preparation plan and recorded Validation Proof.

A validation-only request returns check results and stops. A preview-only request returns not-applied
results and stops. Neither starts preparation, creates infrastructure, or marks deployment complete.
An explicit deployment request still requires current policy checks, preview review, and apply approval.
When a project contains both workflow formats and the requested workflow is unclear, the agent asks first.

For a live, always-current roster, see the
[Architecture Explorer](../../../reference/architecture-explorer/). The count is
computed from `tools/registry/count-manifest.json` and the source of truth is the
`.github/agents/*.agent.md` files on disk.

## First-run project decisions (`iac_tool`, `review_depth`)

The **01-Orchestrator** captures two project-scoped decisions the first
time a project boots (or during the first approval gate after `apex-recall
init`). Both are persisted to `apex-recall` and **never re-asked** —
every downstream agent reads them via `apex-recall show <project>
--json`.

| Decision        | Default                                              | When asked                             | Persistence key         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `iac_tool`      | none (must be chosen)                                | Step 1 (Requirements), Phase 2         | `decisions.iac_tool`    |
| `review_depth`  | `default` — single-pass `comprehensive` (recommended) | Project boot or first gate after init  | `decisions.review_depth` |

**`review_depth` values**:

- `default` — one comprehensive challenger pass at Steps 1, 2, 4 (plus
  a separate cost-feasibility review at Step 2 and `governance-reconciliation` at Step 3.5). Right for most workshops,
  MVPs, and single-region projects.
- `deep` — rotating-lens multi-pass cascade per
  [`adversarial-review-protocol.md`](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/blob/main/.github/skills/apex-azure-defaults/references/adversarial-review-protocol.md)
  (Pass 1 security-governance → Pass 2 architecture-reliability →
  conditional Pass 3 cost-feasibility). Worth the ~3× challenger
  cost for regulated workloads (HIPAA/PCI), prod migrations, or
  multi-region designs.

**Changing the value later** — `01-Orchestrator` writes once and never
re-prompts. To switch a project from `default` to `deep` (or vice
versa) after boot, edit the persisted decision directly:

```bash
apex-recall decide <project> --key review_depth --value deep --rationale "Escalated to deep review after Step 2 reliability gap" --json
```

Alternatively, escalate a **single** artifact without flipping the
whole project by invoking the `10-Challenger` user-invocable agent
manually — it runs the rotating-lens passes against one file on
demand.

Authoritative contract: [01-orchestrator.agent.md
→ `Computing decisions.review_depth`](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/blob/main/.github/agents/01-orchestrator.agent.md#computing-decisionsreview_depth-project-scoped-opt-in).

## Per-Step User Gates (Architect, Design, Governance)

Each user-facing step raises a small, predictable set of questions
before continuing to the next step. The questions exist to keep
creative AI decisions in the user's hands; the agent never
silently assumes a non-default value.

| Step | Gate                              | Question type                                                    | Decision key recorded               |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 2    | SKU confirmation (before pricing) | Approve / Revise / Discuss                                       | `sku_confirmation_status`           |
| 2    | Budget gate (after pricing)       | Approve / Revise SKUs / Revise requirements                      | `budget_decision`                   |
| 2    | Per-finding decisions             | Accept / Reject / Defer / Edit; independent questions in a batched panel | `decision_log` |
| 3    | Diagram generator                 | Python diagrams                                                  | `diagram_tool`                      |
| 3.5  | Phase 2.7 resolution              | RG tag keys + casing, allowed locations (two questions)          | `tag_contract`, `governance_status` |

The full registry of valid decision keys lives at
`tools/apex-recall/docs/decision-keys.md`; the validator
`tools/scripts/validate-decision-keys.mjs` enforces that every
`apex-recall decide --key` reference in an agent file appears in the
registry.

**Tag schema**: discovered Azure Policy defines required keys, values, and casing.
When no inherited tag policy applies, use the canonical greenfield fallback in
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` rather than another tag list.
Legacy casing is preserved only under that source's compatibility rule; `ManagedBy` is optional provenance.

**SKU manifest MD ↔ JSON sync**: the human-readable
`agent-output/{project}/sku-manifest.md` is rendered deterministically
from `sku-manifest.json` via
`node tools/scripts/render-sku-manifest-md.mjs <project>`. Agents
mutate the JSON; the renderer (wired into `lefthook` pre-commit and
CI) re-emits the MD. Hand-editing the MD is forbidden and reverted on
the next commit.

## Subagents

Subagents are not user-invocable. They are delegated to by parent agents for isolated,
specific tasks:

| Subagent                    | Purpose                            | Invoked By          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| challenger-review-subagent  | Adversarial review of artifacts    | Required at Steps 1, 2, 3.5, 4; opt-in at Design and CodeGen |
| cost-estimate-subagent      | ARM MCP pricing queries            | Steps 2, 7          |
| bicep-validate-subagent     | Lint + AVM/security code review    | Step 5 (Bicep)      |
| bicep-whatif-subagent       | `az deployment what-if` preview    | Step 6 (Bicep)      |
| terraform-validate-subagent | Lint + AVM-TF/security code review | Step 5 (Terraform)  |
| terraform-plan-subagent     | `terraform plan` preview           | Step 6 (Terraform)  |

## The Challenger Pattern

:::note[Adversarial Review]
The Challenger finds what everyone else missed — untested assumptions,
governance gaps, WAF blind spots, and architectural weaknesses.
:::

The `challenger-review-subagent` implements adversarial review at critical workflow steps.
It operates with rotating lenses:

:::note[Challenger Selection Rules]
Pass 1 (security-governance) always uses `challenger-review-subagent`.
Additional passes also use `challenger-review-subagent` for
architecture-reliability and cost-feasibility lenses.
See `.github/skills/apex-azure-defaults/references/adversarial-review-protocol.md`
(`## Lenses`, `## Default flow`, `## Opt-in: Deep adversarial review`) for
the full routing table and conditional skip rules.
:::

- **Default review**: comprehensive review is mandatory for Requirements, Architecture, and IaC Plan.
  Architecture also requires an independent cost-feasibility review. Governance uses reconciliation;
  Design and CodeGen review are opt-in. Deploy has no Challenger review; live policy precheck remains required.
- **Multi-pass review** (rotating lenses, opt-in): Multiple separate reviews, each focused on a
  specific dimension (security, reliability, cost). Available for architecture (Step 2),
  planning (Step 4), and code (Step 5) when explicitly requested. Recommended for complex projects.

Findings are classified as `must_fix` (blocking) or `should_fix` (advisory). Only
`must_fix` findings block workflow progression.

**Conditional passes (when multi-pass is opted in)**: Pass 3 of the rotating lens review is
conditional — it only runs if Pass 2 returned ≥1 `must_fix` finding. If Pass 2 returns zero
  `must_fix` items, Pass 3 is skipped entirely. Runtime savings depend on the actual review.

**Context Shredding for Challenger Inputs**: The challenger is instructed to apply
context compression tiers when loading predecessor artefacts for review:

| Context Usage | Loading Strategy                                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 60%         | Full artefact                                                  |
| 60–80%        | Key H2 sections only (resource list, SKUs, WAF scores, budget) |
| > 80%         | Decision summary from `00-session-state.json` + resource list  |

:::caution[Reliability note]
The tier selection above depends on the LLM estimating its own context usage —
there is no runtime API to measure actual token consumption. The LLM may not
apply compression consistently. The **`compact_for_parent` carry-forward** (below)
is the part that reliably works because it is a structural contract in the
subagent's JSON output format, not a voluntary LLM behaviour.
:::

After each review pass, only the `compact_for_parent` string (~200 characters) is carried
forward — not the full JSON findings. This prevents context bloat across multi-pass reviews
and is enforced by the output schema.

:::caution[Unavailable Or Empty Review]
If a required reviewer is unavailable, stop and request a human handoff to
`10-Challenger`. Missing or empty reviewer output permits exactly one
identical-input retry, then a human handoff. Never invoke a nested main-agent
wrapper or fabricate an inline review. Resume from current evidence via
`apex-recall show <project> --json`; missing evidence does not satisfy a gate.
:::

**New Challenger Checklists**: Two mandatory checklist categories were added:

- **Cost Monitoring**: Budget resource, governed notifications, Action Group routing, and anomaly detection.
- **Repeatability**: Parameterised values, multi-tenant deploy, `projectName` required.

## Handoffs and Delegation

Agents communicate through artefact files, not direct message passing. The Orchestrator
offers a human handoff to a step agent, which produces output files in `agent-output/{project}/`.
The next agent reads those files as input. This design:

- Eliminates context leakage between agents
- Enables resume from any point (artefacts are persistent)
- Allows human review at every gate (artefacts are human-readable markdown)
- Supports parallel development of different steps

**Phase Handoff Document**: At each approval gate, the Orchestrator writes a
`00-handoff.md` file containing a summary of what was completed, key decisions
made, what comes next, and (at Gates 2 and 3) a session break recommendation.
This enables resume from any gate without needing to re-read all prior artefacts.

## Creating a Custom Agent

This section walks through creating a new agent from scratch.

### Step 1: Choose Agent Type and Model

| Type            | File Location                               | User-Invocable | Use When                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Top-level agent | `.github/agents/{name}.agent.md`            | Yes            | User-facing workflow steps                |
| Subagent        | `.github/agents/_subagents/{name}.agent.md` | No             | Isolated tasks delegated by parent agents |

Agent frontmatter is the canonical model assignment; `tools/registry/agent-registry.json`
mirrors it. Model changes require explicit approval. The current approved main-agent map is:

| Main Agents | Model |
| --- | --- |
| Requirements, Architect, IaC Planner, Context Optimizer | `gpt-5.6-sol` |
| Orchestrator | `MAI-Code-1.1-Flash` |
| Design, Bicep CodeGen, Terraform CodeGen, As-Built, Diagnose, Challenger | `GPT-5.6-Terra` |
| Governance, Bicep Deploy, Terraform Deploy | `GPT-5.6-Luna` |

Subagent assignments also come from their own frontmatter; do not infer them from
the parent's model. Labels do not establish runtime cost-tier eligibility,
availability, or API support. Stop on unsupported routing rather than substituting
models automatically; preserve unknown Sol metadata as unknown.

Sol, Terra, and Luna main bodies use concise Markdown outcome contracts: Role,
Goal, Success criteria, Constraints, Output, and Stop rules. This is an APEX
authoring convention, not a vendor-specific XML requirement. Leaf workers use
bounded role contracts and return to their parent without nested delegation.

### Step 2: Create the Agent File

Create a `.agent.md` file with the required frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: My Custom Agent
description: "Describe the task. USE FOR: keyword triggers. DO NOT USE FOR: anti-triggers."
model:
  - GPT-5.6-Terra
tools:
  - read
  - edit
  - execute
agents: []
user-invocable: true
disable-model-invocation: true
handoffs:
  - label: "Next Step"
    agent: next-agent-name
    prompt: "Hand off with context..."
---
```

Required frontmatter fields: `name`, `description`, `model`, `tools`.
Production main agents also set `disable-model-invocation: true` for human entry.
Use `agents: []` when no leaf delegation is needed; a nonempty allowlist requires
the `agent` tool and must not target production main agents. Handoffs are optional.

See `.github/instructions/agent-authoring.instructions.md` for the
complete frontmatter specification.

### Step 3: Write the Agent Body

The body (below the frontmatter) is the agent's operating manual:

```markdown
## MANDATORY: Read Skills First

1. **Read** `.github/skills/apex-azure-defaults/SKILL.md`

## DO (required behaviours)

- Always check for existing session state before starting
- Load skills progressively (SKILL.md first, then references/ on demand)

## DO NOT (prohibited behaviours)

- Do not skip approval gates
- Do not hardcode project-specific values
```

Keep the body under 350 lines. Use skill references for deep domain
knowledge rather than inlining it.

### Step 4: Register the Agent

Update the registry file:

1. **`tools/registry/agent-registry.json`** — add the agent's role, file path,
   model, and skill list

### Step 5: Validate

```bash
# Validate frontmatter syntax, body size, and language quality
npm run validate:agents

# Verify registry consistency
npm run validate:agent-registry
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem                     | Cause                           | Fix                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent not appearing in chat | Missing or invalid frontmatter  | Run `npm run validate:agents`                       |
| Tool not available          | Tool not in `tools:` allowlist  | Add the tool name to frontmatter                    |
| Handoff not triggering      | Wrong agent name in `handoffs:` | Verify target agent file exists                     |
| Skills not loading          | Typo in skill path              | Check path matches `.github/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
