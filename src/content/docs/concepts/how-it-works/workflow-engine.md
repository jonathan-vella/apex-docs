### The DAG Model

The workflow is encoded as a machine-readable directed acyclic graph in
`workflow-graph.json`:

```mermaid
flowchart TD



    S1["step-1: Requirements"]
    G1{{"gate-1: Approval"}}:::gate
    S2["step-2: Architecture"]
    G2{{"gate-2: Approval"}}:::gate
    S3["step-3: Design (opt)"]
    S35["step-3.5: Governance"]
    G25{{"gate-2.5: Approval"}}:::gate
    S4["step-4: IaC Plan"]
    G3{{"gate-3: Approval"}}:::gate
    S5B["step-5b: Bicep Code"]
    S5T["step-5t: TF Code"]
    G4{{"gate-4: Validation"}}:::gate
    S6B["step-6b: Bicep Deploy"]
    S6T["step-6t: TF Deploy"]
    G5{{"gate-5: Approval"}}:::gate
    S7["step-7: As-Built"]:::endNode

    S1 --> G1 --> S2 --> G2
    G2 --> S3
    S3 --> S35
    S35 --> G25
    G25 --> S4
    S4 --> G3
    G3 --> S5B & S5T
    S5B & S5T --> G4
    G4 --> S6B & S6T
    S6B & S6T --> G5
    G5 --> S7
```

Each node has a type (`agent-step`, `gate`, `subagent-fan-out`, `validation`), and each
edge has a condition (`on_complete`, `on_skip`, `on_fail`). Step 4 (IaC Plan) is
unified across IaC tools; the workflow forks at Step 5 (Code) and Step 6
(Deploy), with conditional routing governed by the `decisions.iac_tool` field.

:::note[Read-only workflow graph]
The workflow DAG is auto-loaded by the Orchestrator. Users do not edit
`workflow-graph.json` directly. To customise the workflow, modify agent
definitions or skills instead.

### Gates and Approval Points

Five mandatory gates require explicit human confirmation before the workflow advances:

| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Step 1 | User approves requirements                        |
| 2    | Step 2 | User approves architecture and cost estimate      |
| 3    | Step 4 | User approves implementation plan                 |
| 4    | Step 5 | Automated validation passes (lint, build, review) |
| 5    | Step 6 | User approves deployment and verifies resources   |

:::tip[Rejecting a gate]
If a gate produces `must_fix` findings or you want to change direction,
edit the upstream artefact under `agent-output/{project}/` and re-run the
step, or restart from the previous step. Prior artefacts remain on disk
and are reused on the next pass — you never lose context by rejecting a
gate.

### IaC Routing

The `iac_tool` field in `01-requirements.md` determines which track is activated.
Steps 4b, 5b, 6b form the Bicep track; steps 4t, 5t, 6t form the Terraform track.
Only one track is active for a given project.

### Session State and Resume

The `00-session-state.json` file (schema v3.0) provides atomic state tracking:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "3.0",
  "project": "my-project",
  "current_step": 2,
  "steps": {
    "2": {
      "status": "in_progress",
      "sub_step": "phase_2_waf",
      "started": "2026-03-04T10:05:00Z",
      "artifacts": ["agent-output/my-project/02-architecture-assessment.md"]
    }
  }
}
```

VS Code Copilot executes agents serially — only one agent runs at a time.
The v3.0 schema removed the lock/claim protocol (previously in v2.0) since
concurrent agent execution does not occur. Atomic writes (`.tmp` → rename
→ `.bak`) prevent file corruption.

### Session Break Protocol

At Gates 2 and 3, the Orchestrator recommends starting a fresh VS Code Copilot Chat
session. Long-running sessions (3+ hours) experience forced context summarisations
that lose critical decision context. The Session Break Protocol:

1. Orchestrator writes current state to `00-session-state.json`
2. Orchestrator writes `00-handoff.md` with human-readable summary
3. Orchestrator prints a "SESSION BREAK RECOMMENDED" message
4. User starts a new chat, invokes Orchestrator again
5. Orchestrator reads `00-session-state.json`, finds the next pending step, and resumes

This was driven by real-world observation: the malta-catering end-to-end test
experienced 5 forced context summarisations in a single 3h39m session.

## Quality and Safety Systems

### Validation Scripts

Every convention is backed by a machine-enforceable check. The validation suite
runs through `validate:_node` (cache-sharing Node runner with bounded child
commands) and `validate:_external` (parallel external tool validators):

| Category            | Validators                                                                                                                                    |

| Artefact format     | `validate:artifacts`, `lint:artifact-templates`, `lint:h2-sync`                                                                               |

| Instruction quality | `validate:instruction-checks`                                                                                                                 |
| Governance          | `lint:governance-refs`, `lint:mcp-config`                                                                                                     |
| Infrastructure      | `lint:terraform-fmt`, `validate:terraform`, `validate:iac-security-baseline`                                                                  |
| Session state       | `validate:session-state` (also covers deprecated lock/claim field detection)                                                                  |
| Registry/config     | `validate:workflow-graph`, `validate:agent-registry`                                                                                          |
| Code quality        | `lint:json`, `lint:python`, `lint:yaml`                                                                                                       |
| VS Code config      | `validate:vscode`                                                                                                                             |
| Explorer graph      | `validate:explorer-graph`                                                                                                                     |
| Meta                | `lint:version-sync`, `lint:deprecated-refs`, `lint:docs-freshness`, `lint:glob-audit`, `validate:no-hardcoded-counts`, `validate:terminology` |

See [`reference/validation-reference`](../../../reference/validation-reference/)
for the full authoritative list — it is generated from `package.json`.

All validators run via `npm run validate:all`.

### Git Hooks (Pre-Commit and Pre-Push)

**Pre-commit** (sequential, via lefthook): Validates staged files only — markdown lint,
link checks, H2 sync, artefact templates, agent frontmatter, instruction frontmatter,
Python lint, Terraform format and validate.

**Pre-push** (parallel, via lefthook): Diff-based domain routing. The `diff-based-push-check.sh`
script categorises changed files and runs only matching validators:

- `*.bicep` → Bicep build + lint
- `*.tf` → Terraform fmt + validate
- `*.agent.md` → Agent frontmatter + body size
- `*.instructions.md` → Instruction frontmatter
- `SKILL.md` → Skills format + skill size
- `*.json` → JSON syntax
- `*.py` → Ruff lint

### Circuit Breaker

:::danger[Automatic Safety Net]
The circuit breaker halts runaway agent loops before they cause damage.
If you see a `blocked` finding, investigate before retrying.
:::

The circuit breaker pattern protects against runaway agent loops during deployment:

| Anomaly Pattern     | Detection Threshold | Action                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Error repetition    | 3 consecutive       | Halt, write `blocked` finding  |
| Empty response loop | 3 consecutive       | Halt, escalate to human        |
| Timeout cascade     | 3 consecutive       | Halt, check auth               |
| What-if oscillation | 2 cycles            | Halt, flag resource conflict   |
| Auth failure loop   | 2 consecutive       | Halt, prompt re-authentication |

:::note[Example — what “timeout cascade” looks like]
The Deploy agent calls `azd provision` and the Azure Resource Provider
returns 429 (rate-limit). The agent retries twice more without making
progress. The circuit breaker writes a `blocked` finding and stops the
step — it does **not** keep retrying. Recovery: wait 5 minutes, then
re-run the step. The agent reads `00-handoff.md` and resumes from the
last successful sub-step.
:::

### Context Compression

The [`apex-context-management`](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/blob/main/.github/skills/apex-context-management/SKILL.md)
skill defines three runtime compression tiers for artifact loading (it replaces
the legacy `context-shredding` and `context-optimizer` skills; for post-hoc
analysis of past sessions, see the [`11-Context Optimizer`](../agents/) agent):

| Tier         | Trigger    | Strategy                                   |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `full`       | < 60% used | Load entire artefact                       |
| `summarized` | 60–80%     | Key H2 sections only (tables preserved)    |
| `minimal`    | > 80%      | Decision summaries only (< 500 characters) |

:::caution[Partially implemented — know the limits]
**What works today:**

- **Hardcoded compaction checkpoints** — agents like the Architect (Phase 2.5)
  and IaC Planner (Phase 3.6) have fixed points in their bodies where they
  write a summary and stop loading additional skills. These are positional,
  not dynamic.
- **`compact_for_parent` carry-forward** — the challenger subagent's JSON output
  contract limits inter-pass data to a ~200-character string, preventing context
  bloat across multi-pass reviews.

**What does not work today:**

- **Dynamic tier selection** — the 60%/80% thresholds rely on the LLM estimating
  its own context consumption. VS Code Copilot provides no API for agents to
  query actual token usage. The LLM has no reliable way to know whether it is at
  55% or 75% of its context window, so tier triggers are effectively best-effort.
- **Automatic artifact compression** — the per-artifact compression templates
  (`compression-templates.md`) describe which H2 sections to keep per tier, but
  no code enforces this. Compression depends on the LLM reading the template,
  deciding its tier, and selectively extracting sections. In practice, LLMs tend
  to read entire files.

The hardcoded compaction checkpoints in agent bodies are the most reliable
mechanism. The dynamic artifact-tier system is a design intent that nudges
LLM behaviour but is not deterministic. Skills themselves are single-tier
(one `SKILL.md` per skill); the tier system applies only to artifacts in
`agent-output/`.
:::

When the `challenger-review-subagent` loads predecessor artefacts for review, it is
instructed to apply the same 3-tier compression: at the `summarized` tier, preserving
only resource list, SKUs, WAF scores, compliance matrix, and budget sections; at
`minimal`, using only the `decisions` field from `00-session-state.json` plus the
resource list. Whether the LLM follows these instructions consistently varies —
the `compact_for_parent` carry-forward between passes is the part that reliably works.

### Copilot Hooks

Copilot hooks in `.github/hooks/` intercept agent actions at runtime. See the
[Hooks guide](../../../guides/hooks/) for the authoritative list; the current
set covers:

| Hook                  | Trigger                                    | Purpose                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tool-guardian`       | `PreToolUse`                               | Blocks dangerous commands (destructive ops, force pushes, DB drops) |
| `subagent-validation` | `SubagentStop`                             | Validates subagent invocation and outputs                           |

Hooks are defined in `hooks.json` files with type (`command`), path to shell script,
and timeout. They run automatically — agents do not invoke them explicitly.
