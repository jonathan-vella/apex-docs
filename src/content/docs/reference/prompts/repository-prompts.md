APEX includes Local slash adapters in `.github/prompts/`. Their shared procedures
also support explicit manual Host entries. Local discovery settings do not prove
Agent Host discovery or execution support.

Use them for repeatable operational tasks where the prompt needs a precise tool
sequence, predictable exclusions, or a safe confirmation gate.

## Prompt Reference

- `/apex-resume-workflow`: resumes an APEX workflow after `/clear`.
  Source: `.github/prompts/apex-resume-workflow.prompt.md`.
- `/apex-git-commit`: commits, pushes, and handles the PR handoff.
  Source: `.github/prompts/apex-git-commit.prompt.md`.
- `/apex-debug-log-export`: bundles Copilot debug logs for review.
  Source: `.github/prompts/apex-debug-log-export.prompt.md`.

## Resume Workflow

On Agent Host, select `01-Orchestrator` with its configured model and invoke
`/apex-host-workflow-start resume [project]`. The `resume` operation is explicit;
it is not inferred from an empty request or failed recall. With no project supplied,
the procedure discovers candidates and asks only when selection is ambiguous.
No separate Host resume skill is needed. Local `/apex-resume-workflow` remains unchanged.

Use `/apex-resume-workflow` after `/clear` or whenever you need to re-enter an
existing APEX workflow without carrying old chat context forward.

The prompt is bound to `01-Orchestrator` and uses its canonical recovery procedure.
A supplied project is used directly; otherwise it selects a unique candidate or asks which project to resume.
The workflow graph and current evidence determine the next gate or handoff, not a separate next-step questionnaire.

### Resume Behavior

- Lists candidate projects under `agent-output/`.
- Resolves a project from your answer or from the prompt argument.
- Uses `apex-recall show <project> --json` for state, with bounded artifact recovery when required evidence is missing.
- Maps the detected workflow node to an orchestrator handoff button.
- Surfaces the correct handoff without invoking the next agent automatically.

### Resume Usage

Use the slash prompt, attach `tools/apex-prompts/workflow-prompts/00-resume-workflow.prompt.md`,
or send `resume <project>` to the selected Orchestrator. All use the same agent-owned procedure;
plain chat text does not invoke a prompt file automatically. Required approvals remain explicit.

### Resume Boundaries

The prompt does not re-run completed steps by itself, change recorded decisions,
or call `#runSubagent`. It only gets you back to the right orchestrator handoff.

## Git Commit

On Host, use `/apex-host-git-commit` with the required owner and tools already selected.
Commit and debug-log capture are separate operations, not workflow-start modes.

Use `/apex-git-commit` when you want the repository's standard commit workflow:
inspect scoped changes, stage allowed paths, create a conventional commit, push
the current branch, and decide what to do with the pull request.

### Commit Behavior

- Computes pathspec exclusions for `agent-output/`, `infra/`, and the Sensei
  skill directory when applicable.
- Refuses to commit from `main`.
- Stages only the allowed paths.
- Generates a conventional commit message from the staged diff unless you pass a
  subject.
- Pushes the current branch.
- Checks whether an open pull request already exists for the branch.
- Asks whether to update an existing PR, create a new PR, or skip the PR step.

### Commit Usage

Use this prompt after a focused code or documentation change when you want the
repo's commit exclusions and PR decision flow applied consistently.

### Commit Boundaries

The prompt never force-pushes, never stages excluded infrastructure or
`agent-output/` artifacts, and keeps the pull-request action as the final human
confirmation gate.

## Debug Log Export

On Host, use `/apex-host-debug-log-export` with confirmed workspace/session paths.
Do not substitute Local log variables for Host paths. Skills inherit the caller's
model/tools and do not grant new permissions; unavailable prerequisites stop the operation.

Use `/apex-debug-log-export` when you need to package Copilot Chat debug logs
for review. It is especially useful when investigating custom-agent loading,
skill loading, tool behavior, latency, token use, or unexpected retries.

### Export Behavior

- Enumerates debug-log sessions for the current workspace.
- Recommends the most recent non-active session by default.
- Lets you opt into older sessions, transcript JSONL, and workspace logs.
- Builds a custom-agent filter from `.github/agents/` and the agent registry.
- Writes filtered `*.custom-agents.jsonl` files.
- Redacts common secret patterns from filtered output.
- Creates a `.tar.gz` bundle under `.apex-logs/`.

### Export Usage

Use this prompt before filing an upstream Copilot issue or asking another
maintainer to review an APEX agent session. The companion guide is
[Debug Log Export](/guides/apex-debug-log-export/).

### Export Boundaries

The prompt does not upload anything. It preserves raw session logs for auditing,
so you should review the bundle before sharing it outside the repository team.

## Choosing The Right Prompt

Host entries are manual-only (`disable-model-invocation: true`). The source flags
and static tests do not establish native runtime support; verify each harness separately.
